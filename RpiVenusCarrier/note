please be careful in using the files from this directory in your machine. 
 - /RpiVenusCarrierSetup.sh
 - /Files/rc.local
 - /Files/RpiVenusCarrierFunctions

Even though they are the latest files, however you need to change the permissons again .. chmod 755 file.
They are obviously lost during moving the files around in Windows and then cpying to the repo.
Use the Readme.md guide instead with the tar.gz file.
