please be careful in using the files 
 - /RpiVenusCarrierSetup.sh
 - /Files/rc.local
 - /Files/RpiVenusCarrierFunctions
from this directory in your machine. 
Even though they are the latest files, however you need to change the permissons again .. chmod 755 file.
They are obviously lost during moving the files around in Windows and then cpying to the repo.
Use the guide instead with the tar.gz file.
